######
In this project, we were interested to see how a large-bodied, social bird
	influenced the population genetics of a preferred fruit tree compared
	to a less preferred tree.

Files to be included in this directory:
1. Code for fineRADstructure analysis, including R code for plotting
2. Code for calculating genetic distances, Fst, Fis, and geographic distances, 
	including R code for plotting
3. Notes on parameters used for filtering, assembling, calling SNPs, and filtering again

This is not generalized code, but it /is/ the code that was used to get the results in the paper.

Sequence data is housed at NCBI's SRA database as BioProject PRJNA666435.
